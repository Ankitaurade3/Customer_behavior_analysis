An End-to-End Customer Behavior Analytics Project Using Python, SQL & Tableau

📌 Project Overview

This project showcases how customer transaction data can be converted into actionable business intelligence through an end-to-end analytics process. By combining data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and interactive visualization, the project highlights how data supports smarter business decisions.

🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to simulate a real enterprise analytics pipeline, highlighting the ability to translate raw data into strategic insights by:

Cleaning and structuring messy data for analysis
Using SQL for deeper analysis to answer business-critical questions
Building interactive dashboards for stakeholder consumption
Delivering clear insights and recommendations

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning, transformation, and EDA
PostgreSQL / SQL – Business analysis and querying
Tableau – Interactive dashboards and KPI reporting
Jupyter Notebook / Google colab – Analysis documentation

CSV / Relational Tables – Data storage and integration

🔄 Project Flow

Data Preparation (Python) – Imported CSV file , explored, cleaned, and transformed raw customer data in a google colab. 
Database Integration (SQL) – The main idea is to Load the cleaned dataset into a SQL database and structured it for analysis I did it Google colab itself by calling Sqlite3 library. 
Business Analysis (SQL) – Answered key business questions using optimized SQL queries.
Visualization (Tableau) – Built an interactive dashboard connected to the SQL database.
Reporting & Presentation – Documented insights, recommendations, and created a stakeholder-ready presentation.

✅ Final Outcome / Impact

By the end of the workflow, this project delivers a business-ready analytics package:

A clean, SQL-ready dataset
Reusable SQL queries answering key business questions
An interactive dashboard for decision-makers
A concise report + presentation translating data into actions (e.g., discount strategy, loyalty programs, subscription growth)
